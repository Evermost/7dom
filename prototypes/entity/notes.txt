Entity:
	
	state
	
	model
	
	body
	shape

	np *body

	lin_v : in case of dumb entities, this'll always be a scalar over the y axis, or at least over the xy plane
	lin_v_limit	: limit on the magnitude of lin_v, to be exact
	
	ang_v : almost exclusively H
	ang_v_limit : also of the magnitude
	
	update() : sets ang and lin velocities to body, and maybe do other things based on state
	
Mob <- Entity:

	move_randomly() : does whatever to lin/ang velocity, or whatever the idle behavior asks for, really
	
	move_to_location() : does it's very dogged best to move towards a location by changing the velocities
	
Player <- Entity:

	camera : parented to body

	look_mouse() : rotates the body, and therefor changes ang_v, but also rotates the camera R
	
	move_key() : lin_v can also be on +-x for strafing, will use states to decide which direction to move
